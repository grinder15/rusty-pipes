# Rusty Pipes

[![Built With Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/built-with-ratatui/badge.svg)](https://ratatui.rs/)

Rusty Pipes is a digital organ instrument compatible with GrandOrgue sample sets. It features both graphical and text-based user interface, can be controlled via MIDI and play back MIDI files. Rusty Pipes can stream samples from disk instead of load them into RAM, though a RAM precache mode similar to GrandOrgue and Hauptwerk is available too.
